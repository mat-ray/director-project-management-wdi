        <h2>Matt Rayner</h2>
      </div>
    </header>
    <div class="cover-letter">
      <p>Disney has always been where imagination meets innovation. I have built my career at that same intersection — taking ambitious ideas, complex technology, and diverse teams, and turning them into experiences that matter.
</p>
      <p>From transforming research participation at National Institute of Health and Care Research into a service accessible to millions of UK citizens, to reshaping how global travellers interact with Expedia and Avis Budget Group, my work has consistently married technical rigour with human-centred design. At HM Passport Office I led the delivery of a family of digital data services that now underpin identity management at national scale; at the NCA I directed an AI/ML initiative against financial crime, where cutting-edge data science had to balance speed, trust, and accountability. Each of these projects required not just delivery expertise and rigour, but the ability to bring creativity to the structure of delivery itself — finding ways to make the complex feel seamless.
</p>
      <p>I have steered programmes through highly regulated environments, global platforms, and live broadcast deadlines. Whether migrating the BBC’s subtitling service, moving The Pensions Regulator’s infrastructure to Azure, or launching a new diplomat-facing service for the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, I have delivered under scrutiny where the margin for error was zero, but the scope for imagination was vast.
</p>
      <p>What sets me apart is the ability to bridge worlds: between technology and human storytelling, between creative vision and operational excellence. I know how to lead expert teams, inspire stakeholders, and keep focus on both the detail of delivery and the bigger picture of transformation. My approach is collaborative but decisive, pragmatic but imaginative — and always oriented around creating outcomes that feel effortless to the people who use them.
</p>
      <p>This role at Walt Disney Imagineering excites me because it asks for exactly that combination: the discipline of programme and project leadership and the magic of creative problem-solving. I would bring to it not only a proven record of large-scale programme delivery transformation, but the passion to make delivery itself an imaginative act — turning complex programmes into experiences as inspiring as the destinations they enable.</p>

    <h3>Programme – “Be Part of Research” (NIHR)</h3>

    <p><strong>Role / Position:</strong> Programme Director</p>
    <p><strong>Scale:</strong> £250k / 12-person team / 9 months</p>

    <h4>STAR (short form)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Situation/Task:</strong> NIHR’s clinical trial recruitment service failed (9 of 14 points) its GDS assessment and needed urgent, comprehensive service review and redesign.</li>
      <li><strong>Action:</strong> Directed 12-person team (£250k / 9 months), plugged delivery gaps, ran user research, aligned service with GDS standards.</li>
      <li><strong>Result:</strong> Passed GDS re-assessment; platform now supports recruitment of 1m+ trial participants, including underserved groups.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Context / Challenge</h4>
    <p>
    </p>
      NIHR invests over £1.2B annually into health and care research - but they had a problem - not enough people were volunteering to take part. To counter this, NIHR had hired a consultancy to build them a service to recruit 1m volunteers across the UK, and match them to clinical trials. This service is critical to the UK’s competitiveness in attracting clinical trials but had failed its GDS assessment - preventing it from a full rollout and being embedded in the NHS App. Urgent action was required to protect credibility, restore trust and unlock funding for future phases. I and my small team were brought in to work alongside and through the existing delivery partner and NIHR staffers who had delivered the service, and help them turn it into a world-class service offering.

    <h4>Actions / Responsibilities</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Directed review team, identified, prioritised and closed gaps.</li>
      <li>Led user research across diverse communities.</li>
      <li>Redesigned governance and delivery approach to align with GDS.</li>
      <li>Prioritised service design, inclusion and accessibility.</li>
      <li>Refocussed and rehearsed team for successful re-assessment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Outcomes / Impact</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Passed GDS re-assessment, sustainable platform underpinning 1m+ volunteers.</li>
      <li>Broadened reach into multiple under-served communities (low health literacy, low digital literacy).</li>
      <li>Built an effective working relationship with the existing supplier, built on open and respectful communication.</li>
      <li>Aligned service to national policy ambitions post-Lord O’Shaughnessy review.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Programme – Data Product Family Services Transformation (HMPO)</h3>

    <p><strong>Role / Position:</strong> Programme Director</p>
    <p><strong>Scale:</strong> £48m / 100+ person team (civil servants & suppliers) / 2 years</p>

    <h4>STAR (short form)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Situation/Task:</strong> HMPO’s legacy data services were insecure, costly, a blocker to transformation, and going out of support.</li>
      <li><strong>Action:</strong> Directed a £48m programme, embedding agile user-first, product-led culture, and leading a 100+ person team across civil servants and suppliers. Migrated core data services to secure cloud platforms.</li>
      <li><strong>Result:</strong> Delivered modern, cloud-based, sustainable, secure data services, underpinning future transformation and strengthening resilience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Context / Challenge</h4>
    <p>
      The core HMPO data platform and services were outdated – beyond end-of-life – and fragile, holding back wider digital transformation and representing unacceptable risk of failure. As part of UK Critical National Infrastructure, services had to stay up 24/7 while being rebuilt to modern AWS Well-Architected standards. HMPO had contracted a freelance team to build an early PoC, which we then transformed and operationalised.
    </p>

    <h4>Actions / Responsibilities</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Directed large-scale programme, building multi-party team from ground-up.</li>
      <li>Embedded agile, user-focussed, product-led ways of working across teams.</li>
      <li>Maintained service continuity and operational support.</li>
      <li>Rationalised architecture, with a strong focus on building an aligned, strong, sustainable client skill base.</li>
      <li>Co-ordinated across programmes in wider organisation.</li>
      <li>Engaged with board-level stakeholders for reporting, approvals and direction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Outcomes / Impact</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Delivered secure, cloud-based core data platform and services.</li>
      <li>Improved resilience and sustainability of operations, reducing costs and carbon.</li>
      <li>Cultural shift: agile/product-led delivery became embedded within HMPO, with a clear focus on user-needs, reining-in an earlier solely tech-led approach.</li>
      <li>Instilled planning practices at all levels, creating self-sustaining 18+ month roadmaps, with clearly tracked outcomes and benefits.</li>
      <li>Removed organisational blocker on future digital transformation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Programme – AI/ML Anti–Money Laundering Service (NCA JMLIT)</h3>

    <p><strong>Organisation:</strong> National Crime Agency – Joint Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (JMLIT)</p>
    <p><strong>Role / Position:</strong> Programme Delivery Manager</p>
    <p><strong>Scale:</strong> £1.7m / 15-person team / 9 months</p>

    <h4>STAR (short form)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Situation/Task:</strong> The NCA needed to move from a proof-of-concept AI/ML pilot into live operational services against money laundering.</li>
      <li><strong>Action:</strong> Directed team to operationalise an AI/ML model. Established robust governance, data pipelines, and ethical oversight.</li>
      <li><strong>Result:</strong> Delivered a live AI/ML MVP service used operationally in financial crime investigations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Context / Challenge</h4>
    <p>
      The NCA had experimented with AI/ML but failed to move beyond prototypes. Stakes were high: reputational risk if AI failed or was misapplied in law enforcement. It was also a low-trust environment, with Kainos displacing a well-liked incumbent supplier.
    </p>

    <h4>Actions / Responsibilities</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Led a joint Kainos/Faculty.ai team to transition AI tooling from alpha proof-of-concept to live operational use.</li>
      <li>Built data pipelines and cloud infrastructure.</li>
      <li>Instituted ethical safeguards, governance, and auditability.</li>
      <li>Engaged operational users to ensure usability and trust.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Outcomes / Impact</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Service operational in live investigations against money laundering, with forward roadmap for product outlined.</li>
      <li>Demonstrated ability to scale AI responsibly in law enforcement.</li>
      <li>Enhanced NCA’s data-led investigation capability.</li>

    <h3>Programme – Auto-Enrolment Service Transition (Insourcing)</h3>

    <p><strong>Organisation:</strong> The Pensions Regulator (TPR)</p>
    <p><strong>Role / Position:</strong> Programme Lead</p>
    <p><strong>Scale:</strong> £750k / 10-person team / 6 months</p>

    <h4>STAR (short form)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Situation/Task:</strong> Auto-Enrolment service provision needed to be brought in-house rapidly, while transforming how the service was governed and run.</li>
      <li><strong>Action:</strong> Led a cross-supplier team to define the Target Operating Model, SLAs, and responsibilities; sourced new teams; scoped and controlled SOWs with suppliers.</li>
      <li><strong>Result:</strong> Service successfully insourced on time, avoiding significant costs and establishing a clearer, accountable operating model.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Context / Challenge</h4>
    <p>
      The Pensions Regulator needed to insource end-to-end service provision for its flagship UK pensions service, “Auto-enrolment,” from one of the big systems and services integrators after many years. Tight timelines, a critical national service, and a shift from outsourced delivery to an internal, accountable model without disrupting service, whilst rebuilding internal skills, teams, and processes from the ground up.
    </p>

    <h4>Actions / Responsibilities</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Designed TOM, SLAs, RACI, and performance measures.</li>
      <li>Identified capability gaps; stood up internal and supplier teams and onboarding plan.</li>
      <li>Negotiated and managed statements of work (SOWs) with new/existing suppliers.</li>
      <li>Ran transition cut-over plan and assurance gates.</li>
      <li>Monitoring, management, and reporting of progress and performance.</li>

    <h3>Product – Manage Your Move (FCDO DTU)</h3>

    <p><strong>Organisation:</strong> The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office – Digital Transformation Unit (DTU)</p>
    <p><strong>Role / Position:</strong> Principal Product Manager</p>
    <p><strong>Scale:</strong> £320k / 10 people / 18 months</p>

    <h4>STAR (short form)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Situation/Task:</strong> Diplomatic overseas relocations involved weeks of scattered, manual admin across functions and posts, impacting UK diplomatic resources.</li>
      <li><strong>Action:</strong> Led technical delivery of several services (including MS Dynamics). Designed and launched a new service for diplomats to manage relocations end-to-end.</li>
      <li><strong>Result:</strong> Reduced a multi-week administrative burden to minutes, freeing thousands of hours of diplomats’ time annually and improving user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Context / Challenge</h4>
    <p>
      The UK’s Diplomatic Service routinely needs to relocate diplomats to new overseas postings, entailing approximately 120 hours of admin per posting per diplomat – excluding HR processing effort. Legacy, convoluted and fragmented processes spanned HR, estates, IT, passports, training, and security checks. The client required a coherent, re-imagined “tell me once” process and user-centred digital flow, with a high bar on policy compliance and quality data capture and handling.
    </p>

    <h4>Actions / Responsibilities</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Directed technical delivery across platforms (Dynamics, integrations, workflows) and client’s suppliers on behalf of the client.</li>
      <li>Ran discovery-to-live lifecycle with stakeholder groups across FCDO functions and at all levels up to Ambassador.</li>
      <li>Established product backlog, delivery rhythms, and appropriate change control.</li>
      <li>Embedded user-centred design to simplify journeys and reduce handoffs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Outcomes / Impact</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Live service shrank cycle times from weeks to minutes, saving around £4m per annum.</li>
      <li>Improved data quality and auditability across the relocation process.</li>
      <li>Massively popular service, with direct positive feedback from many users.</li>
      <li>Created a pattern others could follow for complex, workflow-heavy services.</li>

    <h3>Programme – “Subito” Broadcast Subtitling Service Launch</h3>

    <p><strong>Organisation:</strong> Red Bee Media</p>
    <p><strong>Role / Position:</strong> Contract Programme Manager</p>
    <p><strong>Scale:</strong> 4 months</p>

    <h4>STAR (short form)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Situation/Task:</strong> High-profile broadcast subtitling service (Sky & BBC) was significantly delayed and at risk of reputational damage.</li>
      <li><strong>Action:</strong> Brought in to deliver a crisis turnaround. Re-baselined backlog of work, reset delivery plan, and restructured programme governance.</li>
      <li><strong>Result:</strong> Successfully recovered trajectory, enabling launch of service to major clients.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Context / Challenge</h4>
    <p>
      I joined the Red Bee team at a critical time to help them take live a badly delayed new in-house broadcast system for live subtitling to major clients such as BBC and Sky. The project had severe scope and quality issues, and reputational risk with end-clients. My remit was to re-establish control, define, and clear the remaining obstacles to going live as quickly as possible. I worked closely with the supplier to get quality and scope back on track, re-baselined the programme for a new target, resulting in a successful on-air broadcast cutover. Additionally, I planned and initiated subsequent programme phases before handing over to a permanent staff member.
    </p>

    <h4>Actions / Responsibilities</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Conducted ‘no-blame’ root-cause review with internal and supplier teams and reprioritised backlog for delivery turnaround.</li>
      <li>Established credible programme plan and governance.</li>
      <li>Aligned suppliers and internal teams under new, sustainable delivery rhythm.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Outcomes / Impact</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Defects resolved, quality delivery re-established.</li>
      <li>Service launched for Sky and BBC.</li>
      <li>Stabilised client confidence in Red Bee’s delivery.</li>
      <li>Created a replicable approach for programme recovery.</li>

    <h3>Programme – EMEA E-commerce Transformation</h3>

    <p><strong>Organisation:</strong> Avis Budget Group</p>
    <p><strong>Role / Position:</strong> Programme Manager</p>
    <p><strong>Scale:</strong> €24m / 100-person blended global team / 12 months</p>

    <h4>STAR (short form)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Situation/Task:</strong> The Avis/Budget brands were launching new full-stack ecommerce B2B & B2C platforms across EMEA, but the programme was derailed with processes, finances, backlog, and scope out of control.</li>
      <li><strong>Action:</strong> Took over programme management, re-baselined backlog using pilot lessons, controlled scope/cost/deadlines, and blended internal + multi-supplier global teams cohesively. Led agile transformation across the business.</li>
      <li><strong>Result:</strong> Delivered platform on time with significant TV advertising campaign; finances and scope brought under control, roadmap defined for future growth.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Context / Challenge</h4>
    <p>
      Avis Budget had started an agile programme to completely revolutionise their online sales, inventory, and digital platforms, but had failed to adopt agile practices successfully and had lost significant control of scope, timelines, and cost. I took over the running of this high-stakes global ecommerce build under severe pressure with daily CIO/CMO and board oversight, failing programme governance, and global suppliers who were not talking to one another.
    </p>

    <h4>Actions / Responsibilities</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Re-baselined programme backlog and financials based on required timescales.</li>
      <li>Instituted strict scope, cost, and deadline controls.</li>
      <li>Coordinated global multi-supplier 100-person team, instilling a “one-team” approach.</li>
      <li>Successfully embedded agile ways of working across business functions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Outcomes / Impact</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>On-time launch, aligned with World Cup marketing campaign.</li>
      <li>Significant increase in delivery pace, predictability, quality, and control.</li>
      <li>Clear roadmap (scope, time, and cost) and improved governance baseline.</li>

    <h3>Programme – Global Affiliate Network Platform Migration</h3>

    <p><strong>Organisation:</strong> Expedia</p>
    <p><strong>Role / Position:</strong> Senior Project Delivery Consultant</p>
    <p><strong>Scale:</strong> 100,000+ global partners / 6 months</p>

    <h4>STAR (short form)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Situation/Task:</strong> Expedia needed to migrate 100,000 global partners onto a new B2B platform, with SEO and speed-to-launch as key success factors.</li>
      <li><strong>Action:</strong> Led team through large-scale migration programme, optimised delivery processes to accelerate onboarding, with a segmented delivery approach.</li>
      <li><strong>Result:</strong> Significant reduction in partner site launch times, improved SEO, and measurable revenue uplift.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Context / Challenge</h4>
    <p>
      Several company-wide, time-critical product initiatives within Expedia were dependent upon two legacy global travel e-commerce platforms being withdrawn from the market. These products had hundreds of thousands of active global partners generating income that had to be migrated to newer products within extremely tight timescales, using a segmented and tailored approach for the highest 5% of partners by revenue, while not losing sight of the “long tail” revenue.
    </p>

    <h4>Actions / Responsibilities</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Directed segmented migration planning and execution across all partner tiers.</li>
      <li>Streamlined onboarding processes.</li>
      <li>Worked with product and engineering teams to optimise SEO outcomes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Outcomes / Impact</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>100k partners migrated on time.</li>
      <li>Reduced time to launch new partner sites.</li>
      <li>Legacy platform decommissioned.</li>
      <li>Boosted SEO and revenue impact.</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>Context / Challenge</h4>
    <p>
      I assembled a development team to design and build a new, structured intranet site including workflow management applications using Agile methodologies within a Prince2 project management framework. After initial analysis, draft site mapping, and wire-framing, I split the programme into 5 projects forming the fully integrated website service suite. I was responsible for all aspects of delivery, including training, operational handover, and managing business process transformation.
